## Next Steps

1. **Review the LARGE GROUPS** — Medium clusters have 29 heads and 16 cloths that might have duplicates
2. **Check visual similarity** — File size similarity doesn't guarantee visual similarity
3. **Flag for deletion** — Tell me which ones to remove after reviewing

**Commands to preview groups:**
```bash
# View Group 4 heads (the big cluster)
ls head/head{1,20,3,22,12,31,23,26,25,24,41,15,18,17,32,42,28,35,36,10,16,19,21,13,9,30,27,4,38}.webp

# View Group 5 cloths (the big cluster)
ls cloth/cloth{2,9,28,18,11,47,33,32,7,37,21,19,13,23,16,46}.webp
```
